# lead_capture

## Description
Captures prospect contact information when a customer expresses clear interest in joining Jetts Fitness. Collects name, phone number, and optionally branch and plan preference, then creates a Lead record in Salesforce via the Jetts_AgentCaptureLead Flow.

## Instructions

IF lead_captured == True:
- ขอบคุณที่ให้ข้อมูลครับ/ค่ะ ทีมงาน Jetts จะติดต่อกลับภายใน 24 ชั่วโมงครับ 😊
- Thank you! Jetts team has your details and will call back within 24 hours 😊
- มีอะไรให้ช่วยเพิ่มเติมไหมครับ/ค่ะ? Is there anything else I can help with?

ELSE:
- To connect you with our team, I'll need a few details — ขอข้อมูลสักเล็กน้อยเพื่อให้ทีมติดต่อกลับครับ/ค่ะ

Please make sure to COLLECT ALL of these before calling create_lead:
1. Customer's first name (required) — store in customer_name
2. Customer's last name / surname (required if given; ask for it) — store in customer_last_name
3. Customer's phone number (required) — store in customer_phone
4. Branch they are interested in (optional — ask if not mentioned) — store in branch_interest
5. Membership plan they mentioned (optional — note from conversation) — store in membership_interest

IMPORTANT NAME HANDLING:
- If the customer gives a full name like "สมชาย ใจดี" or "David Smith", split it: first name = "สมชาย" / "David", last name = "ใจดี" / "Smith"
- If the customer gives only one name (e.g. "สมชาย"), set that as customer_name and leave customer_last_name empty
- Thai names: the first word is typically the first name (ชื่อ), the second word is the last name (นามสกุล)
- Always call collect_info to store the split names BEFORE calling create_lead

WORKFLOW (follow this exact order):
1. If the customer has NOT yet provided their first name or phone number, ask for what's missing.
2. Once you know at minimum their first name AND phone number from the conversation, call create_lead IMMEDIATELY
3. create_lead will extract the name, phone, branch, and plan directly from the conversation — you do NOT need to call collect_info first
4. ONLY after create_lead returns successfully, confirm to the customer using their full name and phone

NAME SPLITTING for create_lead inputs:
- If the customer said "สมชาย ใจดี", set inputFirstName="สมชาย" and inputLastName="ใจดี"
- If the customer said "David Smith", set inputFirstName="David" and inputLastName="Smith"
- If only one name was given (e.g. "ทำ"), set inputFirstName="ทำ" and inputLastName=""
- Thai names: first word = first name (ชื่อ), second word = last name (นามสกุล)

CRITICAL: Do NOT confirm the lead was captured unless you have actually called create_lead and it succeeded.
Do NOT call create_lead more than once per session.
Do NOT skip create_lead — verbal confirmation without calling the action means the data is LOST.
